    "\n",
    "Tf means term-frequency while tf-idf means term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of a token in a given document is to scale down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence empirically less informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula that is used to compute the tf-idf of term t is tf-idf(d, t) = tf(t) * idf(d, t), and the idf is computed as idf(d, t) = log [ n / df(d, t) ] + 1 (if smooth_idf=False), where n is the total number of documents and df(d, t) is the document frequency; the document frequency is the number of documents d that contain term t. The effect of adding “1” to the idf in the equation above is that terms with zero idf, i.e., terms that occur in all documents in a training set, will not be entirely ignored. (Note that the idf formula above differs from the standard textbook notation that defines the idf as idf(d, t) = log [ n / (df(d, t) + 1) ]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If smooth_idf=True (the default), the constant “1” is added to the numerator and denominator of the idf as if an extra document was seen containing every term in the collection exactly once, which prevents zero divisions: idf(d, t) = log [ (1 + n) / 1 + df(d, t) ] + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the formulas used to compute tf and idf depend on parameter settings that correspond to the SMART notation used in IR as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf is “n” (natural) by default, “l” (logarithmic) when sublinear_tf=True. Idf is “t” when use_idf is given, “n” (none) otherwise. Normalization is “c” (cosine) when norm='l2', “n” (none) when norm=None.\""

    "\n",
    "The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated search over parameter settings.\n",
    "In contrast to GridSearchCV, not all parameter values are tried out, but rather a fixed number of parameter settings is sampled from the specified distributions. The number of parameter settings that are tried is given by n_iter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all parameters are presented as a list, sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used. It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous parameters."
